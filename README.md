## OverView
The goal of this project is to build a classification model for predicting the species of iris flowers. Using logistic regression, the model classifies flowers based on four physical measurements. The notebook includes data loading, model training, and evaluation with accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report.

Dataset
Source: Iris dataset (built-in scikit-learn)
