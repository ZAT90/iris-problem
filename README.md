# Iris Flower Classification Problem

A Jupyter Notebook project to classify iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal dimensions using logistic regression.

Project Overview
This notebook trains a logistic regression model to predict iris species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The model is evaluated using accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report.

Dataset
Source: Iris dataset (built-in scikit-learn)
Features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width
